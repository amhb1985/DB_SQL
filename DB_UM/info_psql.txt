# this is about test and training for / about the psql course in coursera by. UM


# now we try to do test some DB connection inside of the psql
 
 for the connection we can use the info under Dr chuk website pg4e:

 Host:     pg.pg4e.com 
Port:     5432 
Database: pg4e_e76eca22f4 

User:     pg4e_e76eca22f4 
Password:  (hide/show copy) 

# now we can use the python for every one 
 we can finde the Dashborad after register in website pythonanywhere.com (by Anaconda)

 next we must use the console screen to do and test the codees again

#after that we r going to the consule we r choosing the bash consule that is for
Linux
 under the website :

now.... let do it weird !!!
1. we try  with pwd >>>
we can see  our name here: home/mhb1985 

we can see that we cannnot run the both of code pwd or ls inside of our psql

we have some another commend that we must notice that it will just do in the bash console:
like:
ls >> see the folder
mkdir >> make directory 
cd >> change directory and going inside of one folder
cd ~ >> go up from one foder (in the mac we msut use  option + N keys together) 


so after that we r going again to the website python anywhere and we try to see or change some File
inside of this website  

then we try the bash for Linux add this one to join it:
ppsql -h pg.pg4e.com -p 5432 -U pg4e_e76eca22f4 pg4e_e76eca22f4

and after that we must put our password.

now we can seethe both of them running together 
i mean the both of terminal online under 
1.bash terminal 
2,.psql terminal 

for the backslash: \
option + shift + 7
but ist not working under bash terminal in Linux!!
for the solving this we can just use th Right option NOT left option key

so then we test the first query for our Database under pg4e 
SELCT * FROM pg4e_meta ;
so we can all of selected in our table

# after run the Queri we can see the both Termial working and show the result inside the table

so then we close the bash or psql with the \q
